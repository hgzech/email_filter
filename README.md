The app works by checking the domain part of email addresses. It
regularly generates a list of verified domains, for example based on
emails I have sent in the past. If a domain is not in the verified list,
it checks the domains age. If the domain is very young (e.g. \< 1 year),
it categorizes the email as junk and moves it to a folder for future
review.
